* ~~Implementation of function for parsing Json (2-4 hours)~~
* ~~Implementation of AsynkTask with function (20-40 minutes)~~
* ~~Implementation of fragments XML (10-30 minutes)~~
* ~~RecyclerView with fake info (30 minutes - 1 hour)~~
* ~~RecyclerView with real info from Json (30 minutes - 1 hour)~~
* ~~Fragment, without info, by tapping an item fron the RecyclerView (10 - 15 minutes)~~
* ~~Fragment, with info from Json, by taping an item from the RecyclerView (1.5 - 2 hour)~~

In conclusion, we have app, that parse JSON from server, implement RecycleView with CardView, and after tapping card app will open new fragment with more inf–æ.

P.S. App have disgusting design in "More info".
